# SlaCVots
A bot server for Slack. Made with love at SCV

## Introduction

At SCV we use Slack, and we love to create bots for it, both for fun stuff and also to assist us on day to day activities. This project is our server to host different bots and avoid the boilerplate to create a service for them and connect them to the Slack API every time.

It also provides a helpful web interface to monitor and manage your bots
